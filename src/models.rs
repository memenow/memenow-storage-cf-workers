//! # Data Models and Types
//!
//! This module defines the core data structures used throughout the file storage service.
//! All models are designed to be serializable for storage in Durable Objects and
//! network transmission via JSON APIs.
//!
//! ## Core Types
//!
//! - `UserRole`: Enumeration of user roles for file organization
//! - `UploadMetadata`: Complete metadata for an upload session
//! - `UploadStatus`: State tracking for upload progress
//!
//! ## Design Principles
//!
//! - All types implement `Serialize` and `Deserialize` for JSON compatibility
//! - Enums use string representations for API clarity
//! - Metadata includes comprehensive tracking information
//! - UTC timestamps for global consistency

use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

/// User role enumeration for file organization and access control.
///
/// User roles determine how files are organized in R2 storage and may be used
/// for future access control features. Each role corresponds to a different
/// directory structure in the storage bucket.
///
/// # Storage Organization
///
/// Files are organized by role as follows:
/// - `Creator`: `/creator/{user_id}/{date}/{category}/{filename}`
/// - `Member`: `/member/{user_id}/{date}/{category}/{filename}`
/// - `Subscriber`: `/subscriber/{user_id}/{date}/{category}/{filename}`
